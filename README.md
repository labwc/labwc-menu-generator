# labwc-menu-generator

## Features

- Independent of Desktop Environments and associated menu-packages.  This is
  achieved by categorising system .desktop files against a built-in
  directory-schema rather than parsing .menu and .directory files (see
  [Menu Specification]).

- [Desktop Entry Specification] compliant parsing of `Desktop Entry` .desktop
  files.

- Openbox 3.6 formatted output.

- Localized values for .desktop file keys such as `Name[sr_YU]`
